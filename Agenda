Project Agenda: The RBE CityPhase 1: Defining the "Stand-Alone" City Blueprint (Updated)The goal of this phase is to create a core, repeatable Blueprint for your generic city, directly informed by The Venus Project's model of a self-sufficient, holistic system.System Breakdown & Physical Form: We will design the city based on a circular, radial form. This form is not just aesthetic; it's a functional model for efficiency.Central Core: Design a central "brain" or a cybernetic system that manages and optimizes all city operations.First Ring (Core Systems): Define this ring as the location for research facilities, energy hubs, and the primary data center that supports the central core.Second Ring (Habitation): Define the residential and living areas. This ring will focus on livability and accessibility to all other systems.Third Ring (Food Production): Define the primary area for automated food production, including vertical farms, greenhouses, and aquaculture.Outer Ring (Production & Reclamation): Define the outer circle as the location for automated production, manufacturing, and the resource reclamation/recycling center.Transportation Network: Integrate a high-speed, automated transportation system (e.g., monorail) that connects all rings and the central core, eliminating the need for individual vehicles.Resource Flow & Automation Diagram: We will create a detailed diagram showing how resources are managed and how systems interact without human labor. The diagram will illustrate how the central core coordinates the flow of energy from the First Ring to power production in the Outer Ring and food in the Third Ring, and how reclaimed materials are cycled back into production.High-Level Blueprint Definition: We will translate this interconnected, circular model into a high-level plan for a master Unreal Engine Blueprint that represents the city. This will serve as the foundation for all future cities.Phase 2: Integrating with Real-World Resources (Refined)Once we have our generic city model, we will connect it to the real world. This phase is about grounding your fictional city in a realistic, resource-based system.Geographical Research: We will research a few real-world geographical locations and their primary resources (e.g., a desert location has abundant solar energy but scarce water).Location-Specific Parameters: We will create a list of parameters for each location based on its resource availability. This will directly influence the balance of systems within each city blueprint. For example, a "Desert City Blueprint" would have a high energy output from solar but a low water input, while a "Rainforest City Blueprint" would be the opposite.World Network Plan: We will design a simple system for how these diverse, resource-specific cities would interact to contribute to a larger global network. This will include defining what resources are exchanged and the basic rules of that exchange.Phase 3: Building the First Prototype in Unreal (Unchanged)With our plan complete, we'll start bringing it to life. This phase will leverage the Blueprint knowledge you've already started to build.Create the Core City Actor: We will create a new Blueprint Actor to serve as the master city object.Implement System Logic: Using the principles from Phase 1, we will add the basic logic for each system. Instead of complex visual effects, we'll use simple variables and print strings to track and display resource levels. For example, the energy system will just add a certain number to a "Power" variable every second.Develop Location-Specific Instances: We will create multiple instances of the city blueprint, each with parameters set for a different real-world location (e.g., one for the desert, one for the rainforest).Test the Network: We will use simple communication between the cities to see if they can "trade" resources and balance each other out, proving your core concept.
