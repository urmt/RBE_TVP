# The RBE City: A Systems-Based Unreal Engine Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a conceptual model of a futuristic, self-sufficient city based on the principles of a **Resource-Based Economy (RBE)** and the architectural concepts of **The Venus Project (TVP)**. The primary goal is to create a digital prototype in **Unreal Engine** that demonstrates the functional relationships between key urban systems, such as energy, food production, waste management, and local manufacturing.

The city design is based on a **circular, radial form** optimized for efficiency and is intended to be a foundational Blueprint that can be adapted to various real-world geographical locations and their unique resources.

## Key Features

- **Holistic, Circular Design:** The city is structured in concentric rings, with each ring dedicated to a specific function (e.g., habitation, food production, etc.).
- **Cybernetic Management:** A central "brain" manages and optimizes all city systems to ensure maximum efficiency and resource utilization.
- **Automated Systems:** The model assumes fully automated production, food growth, and waste reclamation, eliminating the need for human labor in these areas.
- **Integrated Transportation:** A high-speed, automated monorail system provides seamless travel between all city rings.
- **Dynamic Resource Balancing:** Different city instances can be placed in diverse, real-world locations and "trade" resources with each other to create a stable, global network.

## Project Phases

This project is divided into three main phases, as outlined in the `agenda.md` file:

1. **Defining the Blueprint:** The conceptual design and definition of the core city systems.
2. **Real-World Integration:** Researching and applying real-world resource data to the city blueprints to create diverse city models.
3. **Building the Unreal Prototype:** The practical implementation of the city logic within Unreal Engine.

## Getting Started
