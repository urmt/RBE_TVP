Food Production System: 3D Model Specification1. OverviewThe Food Production system will be a visually striking architectural element of the city. The models should have a clean, futuristic, and functional aesthetic. They should be modular to allow for easy placement and scaling.2. Core ModelsSM_FoodTower_ADescription: The primary hydroponic growth tower. A tall, cylindrical structure with a slightly wider base.Dimensions: Approximately 10m diameter, 40m height.Details:Subdivided tiers with slots for "growth pods."A central, semi-transparent pipe running from top to bottom, representing water/nutrient flow.Subtle glowing lines on the surface to indicate power/data transfer.Polygons: Optimized for performance (low-poly), but with enough detail for close-up shots.Material: M_Buildings_FoodProduction.SM_FoodPod_ADescription: A small, modular pod that fits into the tiers of the SM_FoodTower.Dimensions: Approximately 2m x 2m x 1m.Details:A semi-transparent, glass-like dome on top to show the growing plant inside.A small light source inside the pod to act as a "grow light."Polygons: Very low-poly.Material: M_Buildings_FoodProduction.SM_WaterReservoir_ADescription: A large, circular tank at the base of the food towers.Dimensions: Approximately 15m diameter, 5m height.Details:Semi-transparent material to show the water level inside.Pipes connecting it to the SM_FoodTower.Polygons: Low-poly.Material: M_Buildings_FoodProduction_Water.3. MaterialsThe models should use a PBR (Physically Based Rendering) workflow.M_Buildings_FoodProduction: A clean, white or light-colored material with subtle metallic and roughness variations. It should have a clean, polished look.M_Buildings_FoodProduction_Water: A semi-transparent material with a slightly blue tint. It should have a smooth, reflective surface to simulate water.4. AnimationGrowth Cycle: The SM_FoodPod_A model should have a simple animation where a small plant model "grows" in size from the ground up as the GrowthProgress variable increases from 0.0 to 1.0. This can be handled by a simple scale animation driven by a Blueprint.
