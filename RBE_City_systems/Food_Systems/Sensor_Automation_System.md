# RBE City: Sensor Integration and Automation Systems

## 2. Sensor Integration and Automation

The system's "bulletproof" nature comes from comprehensive automation, managed by the Core Computer. A network of sensors will continuously monitor all key environmental parameters, providing data for real-time adjustments and predictive maintenance.

- **Moisture Sensors:** In hydroponic systems using a medium, these sensors ensure roots are not over- or under-watered. In aeroponics, they would monitor the humidity within the root chamber.
- **Temperature & Humidity Sensors:** These monitor the air and water temperature, as well as ambient humidity. They trigger climate control systems to maintain ideal conditions for specific crops, preventing mold and plant stress.
- **Nutrient Sensors:** These are crucial for a healthy harvest. They measure two key parameters:
  - **Electrical Conductivity (EC):** Measures the concentration of dissolved nutrient salts in the water. The system automatically adds nutrients to the reservoir when levels drop.
  - **pH Level:** Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water, which affects nutrient absorption. The system automatically adjusts pH with acid or base solutions.
- **Light Sensors (Photosynthetically Active Radiation - PAR):** These measure the amount of light available to plants and are used to control energy-efficient LED grow lights. They can be programmed to simulate any season or day length.
- **In-line Flow and Level Sensors:** Monitor the water level in reservoirs and ensure pumps are running correctly. This is a critical redundancy check.
- **Pest and Insect Sensors:** A combination of optical sensors (cameras with computer vision) and gas sensors (detecting specific volatile organic compounds released by stressed plants) will provide early warnings of infestations. Automated pest management could then be deployed, such as the release of beneficial insects or targeted misting.

## 3. Redundancy and Reliability

A truly "bulletproof" system must be resilient to failure.

- **Modular Design:** The food system will not be a single monolithic farm, but a series of interconnected, independent modules. If one module fails due to a pump malfunction or sensor error, it can be isolated for repair without impacting the rest of the city's food supply.
- **Automated Backup Systems:** Every critical component (pumps, climate control, nutrient dosers) will have a redundant backup that automatically engages upon primary failure. The Core Computer will alert maintenance crews to the issue.
- **Distributed Energy:** The farms will be designed to run on a variety of energy sources, not just the main grid. This includes solar panels and battery storage for continued operation during power outages.
- **Data Logging and Analytics:** All sensor data will be logged and analyzed by the Core Computer. This allows for predictive maintenance, where patterns indicating a potential component failure are identified before the failure actually occurs.

This proposed system is highly automated and designed for maximum efficiency and resilience. It combines proven techniques with redundant technologies to create a truly dependable food source.
