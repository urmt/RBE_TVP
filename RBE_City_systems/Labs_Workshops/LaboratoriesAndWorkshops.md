# Laboratories & Workshops: A Systems Plan

This document outlines a plan for a network of interconnected laboratories and workshops. In a resource-based economy, these facilities are not just for specialists, but are hubs of creativity, education, and innovation, accessible to every resident.

## 1. Core Principles

The network of labs and workshops operates on three foundational principles:

**Universal Access:** Every resident has access to the uplifting tools and resources they need for personal projects, research, and collaborative work.

**Specialization & Integration:** The network includes both general-purpose workshops for the public and highly specialized laboratories for advanced research. All facilities are integrated through the Core Computer.

**Resource Optimization:** The system ensures all tools, materials, and equipment are used efficiently, preventing redundancy and waste.

## 2. Network Tiers & Functions

The system is organized into two primary tiers, each serving a distinct purpose while being linked by a common logistical backbone.

### Tier 1: Community Workshops

These facilities are located in every city sector and are designed for general public use. They are places for hands-on learning, fabrication, and collaboration on a smaller scale.

**3D Printing & Fabrication Bays:** Equipped with an array of multi-material 3D printers, laser cutters, and CNC machines. Residents can create prototypes or custom parts for any project.

**Basic Robotics & Electronics:** These areas provide soldering stations, circuit board presses, and a wide variety of electronic components for building and repairing devices.

**Woodworking & Metalworking:** These traditional workshops are fully equipped with automated and semi-automated tools, providing a space for both artistry and practical construction.

**Core Computer Interface:** Each workshop has a local interface to the Core Computer. Residents can reserve equipment, order materials from the central supply, and access design files from the city's database.

### Tier 2: Specialized Laboratories

These facilities are for advanced scientific research and complex engineering projects. Access to these labs is granted based on project need and required expertise, not on status.

**Biotechnology & Medical Research:** These labs are equipped for genetic sequencing, cell culture, and pharmaceutical development, working in conjunction with the healthcare system to address community health needs.

**Material Science & Nanotechnology:** These labs focus on the creation of new materials with specific properties, and the development of nanoscale devices.

**Environmental & Geophysical Research:** These facilities are dedicated to monitoring and optimizing the city's environment, energy systems, and resource management.

**Controlled Access:** Due to the sensitive nature of the equipment and materials, access is managed by the Core Computer to ensure safety and security.

## 3. The Core Computer's Role

The Core Computer is the central nervous system for all labs and workshops, managing operations from a high level.

**Resource & Inventory Management:** The system tracks every piece of equipment and all raw materials in every facility. When a project requires a specific material, the Core Computer can instantly locate it, schedule its delivery via the transportation network, and reserve the necessary equipment.

**Predictive Maintenance:** Sensors embedded in tools and machines monitor usage and wear. The system can predict component failure and schedule proactive maintenance, preventing unexpected downtime and ensuring every tool is always in optimal condition.

**Safety & Training Modules:** Before a resident can use a piece of complex equipment, the Core Computer requires them to complete a mandatory training and safety module, ensuring a safe working environment.

**Project Collaboration:** The system hosts a database of all ongoing projects. Residents can search for projects by interest and connect with collaborators from across the city, fostering a culture of open innovation.

## 4. Integration with Other Systems

The Labs and Workshops network is designed to be a fully integrated module of the Core Computer.

**With Transportation:** The goods transportation system is used to deliver materials and move finished products between facilities.

**With Education:** The education system's curriculum is directly linked to the labs and workshops. Students learn theory in virtual classrooms and then apply that knowledge with hands-on projects in the real-world labs.

**With CAD-CAM:** The city's CAD-CAM system is the primary design tool for all projects. Designs created in the CAD-CAM system can be sent directly to fabrication equipment in the workshops.
