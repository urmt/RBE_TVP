RBE City Simulation
This project is a web-based simulation of a resource-based economy (RBE) city, based on the principles of The Venus Project (TVP). The simulation aims to model the interconnections between a city's core systems, including:

Food Production: Automated hydroponic farms and aquaponics.

Waste Management: A closed-loop recycling and composting network.

Healthcare: A proactive, data-driven system for health and wellness.

Transportation: A unified, on-demand network for people and goods.

Labs & Workshops: Community-accessible spaces for innovation and creation.

Education: A system for self-directed, problem-based, lifelong learning.

The simulation will serve as a foundational blueprint for a real-world, technologically advanced, and sustainable society.
