Automated Transportation System: A Comprehensive Plan
This plan outlines the architecture for a fully integrated and automated transportation network for a resource-based economy city. The system is designed to eliminate private vehicles, reduce congestion, and provide efficient, on-demand travel for people and goods.

1. Core Principles
The transportation system operates on three foundational principles:

Automation: All vehicles are autonomous, managed by the Core Computer to ensure efficiency and safety.

Integration: The network for moving people and goods is unified, allowing for a seamless flow of all resources.

On-Demand Service: The system provides instant, personalized transport for every resident, eliminating the need for rigid schedules.

2. Network Tiers
The transportation network is divided into three interconnected tiers, each optimized for different travel speeds and distances.

Tier 1: Local Pod Network
This is the city's primary mode of public transportation, designed for travel within districts and for "last-mile" delivery.

On-Demand Pods: Residents request a pod through a mobile interface or public kiosks. These pods are small, autonomous electric vehicles that can be shared or private.

Dynamic Routing: The Core Computer's transportation module instantly calculates the most efficient route, considering all other active pods, passenger destinations, and real-time traffic data. The pods can reroute dynamically to avoid congestion or pick up new passengers.

Seamless Interfacing: The pods are designed to interface seamlessly with Tier 2 hubs, allowing passengers to transfer from a local pod to a high-speed vehicle without ever leaving a secure environment.

Tier 2: Inter-District Network
This network facilitates rapid travel between different city districts or hubs.

High-Speed Autonomous Vehicles: These are larger, faster pods that travel on dedicated, grade-separated magnetic levitation (maglev) or elevated trackways. They are designed for longer journeys within the city.

Automated Hubs: Dedicated hubs serve as transfer points. A local pod docks at a hub, and passengers can exit onto an automated moving walkway that takes them to the next high-speed vehicle.

Efficiency: This tiered approach prevents high-speed vehicles from being bogged down by frequent stops, allowing for rapid transit across the city.

Tier 3: Inter-City & Goods Transport
This tier is the logistical backbone of the entire RBE city, handling both long-distance passenger travel and all large-scale goods transport.

Maglev Trains: For travel between cities, a high-speed maglev rail system is used. These trains are automated and can reach extremely high speeds, making long-distance travel fast and efficient.

Autonomous Freight: The same maglev tracks can be used by specialized freight containers. The Core Computer schedules the movement of these containers to ensure that raw materials and finished goods are always delivered on a just-in-time basis.

Dynamic Logistics: This system is fully integrated with the Core Computer's inventory and manufacturing modules. If the Core Computer identifies a need for a specific resource, it can instantly dispatch an autonomous freight container to retrieve it, optimizing the entire supply chain.

3. The Core Computer Transportation Module
The Core Computer's transportation module is the single point of control for the entire network.

Simulation & Optimization: The module runs a real-time simulation of the entire network. It predicts traffic flow, anticipates demand, and dynamically reroutes vehicles to prevent congestion. It uses machine learning to learn from past patterns and improve its routing algorithms over time.

Predictive Maintenance: Sensors on all vehicles and tracks continuously report on the status of every component. The system can predict component failure and automatically schedule a vehicle for maintenance before it breaks down, ensuring the network is always operational.

Energy Management: The module manages the energy consumption of the entire network. It can strategically time freight movements to coincide with periods of low energy demand, or use regenerative braking to feed energy back into the grid.
